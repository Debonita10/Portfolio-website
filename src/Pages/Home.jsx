       I would like to express my keen interest in the frontend developer position. I have learned and applied my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Bootstrap, Redux in various projects.I am currently doing internship as frontend intern in Unified mentorship.I have done a previous internship in Alphawizz Technologies in the same domain where I developed a responsive and fully functional e-commerce website with fetch api and redux. More projects were on login pages, chat interfaces, etc.Â I am confident that I can quickly adapt to a fast-paced environment and become a valuable asset to your team. I am eager to learn and grow within your organization.
